# 🥦 Green Harvest - Organic Produce Delivery Landing Page

A fully responsive landing page built from a Figma design for a fictional organic vegetable delivery service. This project focuses on performance, clean UI implementation, and optimized layout using modern web technologies.

## 🚀 Project Summary

This landing page promotes organic vegetable boxes and aims to generate leads through a contact form. While the design and copy were provided, the implementation focused on bringing the vision to life with smooth animations, pixel-perfect responsiveness, and performance best practices.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Recreate the Figma design accurately using clean, maintainable code
- Ensure excellent performance, SEO, and accessibility scores
- Implement smooth UI animations with Framer Motion
- Make the layout fully responsive across all devices

## 🧠 What I Worked On

- **Layout & Styling**: Translated the design into responsive code using Tailwind CSS
